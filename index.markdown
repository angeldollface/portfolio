I graduated this year from the University of Vienna in English Literature, I write code, I make and mix music, I write on various things on my blog, and I make art. I also hang out on Discord every now and again and try to help people if I can. If you want to listen to my mixes, check out my YouTube channel. I’ve also been coding for the past 12 years and I’ve learned a few things in that time. If you want to view any of the software I’ve built, you can do so on my GitHub profile.
